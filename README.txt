After a lot of digging, unfortunately I was unable to figure out how to make a 'requirements.txt' 
nor was I able to organize my folder structure and I do apologize.

To get the project running:
pip install cutie
pip install keyboard

run 'main.py' in Python 3.

if followed correctly, this should work. 
I believe those are all libraries, do let me know if I am wrong.

I have NOT had the time to do a full playtest so there may be various bugs or errors. If this happens and it becomes a softlock or 
something crucial, I will fix it as soon as I am able.

The project is largely unfinished and I may return to it to finish things up in the future, so at the moment it is unbeatable.
However, this is a fair bit of content explain in the instrucitons on the menu screen.
