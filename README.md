# Python-RPG
A small text based Roguelike RPG I created for my final python project, includes a flexible battle system, and complex interactions.

### HOW TO RUN:
``pip install cutie``
<br/> 
``pip install keyboard``
<br/> 
`run 'main.py' in Python 3.

The project is largely unfinished and I may return to it to finish things up in the future, so at the moment it is unbeatable.
However, this is a fair bit of content explain in the instrucitons on the menu screen.
