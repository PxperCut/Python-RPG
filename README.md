# python-rpg
a small text based roguelike rpg i created for my final python project, includes a flexible battle system, and complex interactions.

### how to run:
``pip install cutie``
<br/> 
``pip install keyboard``
<br/> 
``pip install termcolor``
<br/> 
`run 'main.py' in Python 3.

the project is largely unfinished and i may return to it to finish things up in the future, so at the moment it is unbeatable.
however, there is a fair bit of content. the instructions are mostly explained on the menu screen but for a deeper dive,


## features

- **procedural map generation**  
  a randomized dungeon and map system.
  
- **room types**  
  - item rooms with loot to come across
  - enemy rooms with monsters
  - entity rooms with characters and an abundance of other things.

- **combat system**  
  turn-based battle styling using sp (skill points) and strategic inventory usage.

- **inventory**  
  - collect and store limited items  
  - some items have very unique interactions
<br/> 
the game also includes a secret boss, that isn't actually all that secret considering there aren't many rooms to come across. however, he is still generally much rarer than the other rooms so it's less likely you'll come across him. in the future i might go about finishing this, but really my only plans were to add an ending, a few bosses, new rooms and new floors. if you come across this little project, i'd love to hear your thoughts.
